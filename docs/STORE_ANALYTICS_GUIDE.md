âœ… **Historical data** retention  
âœ… **Multi-currency support** automatically  
âœ… **Tax and fee calculations** included  
âœ… **Fraud detection** by the stores

## When You Might Need a Custom Backend

Consider implementing webhooks (Option 2) only if you need:

- **Real-time notifications** in your own app
- **Custom analytics** not provided by stores
- **Integration** with other business tools
- **User-specific data** beyond subscriptions
- **Advanced automation** based on subscription events

## Recommendation

For most apps, **use the built-in store analytics**. They provide comprehensive subscription tracking without the complexity and cost of maintaining your own backend infrastructure.

The store analytics are the same data used for your payouts and tax reporting, so they're guaranteed to be accurate and up-to-date.
